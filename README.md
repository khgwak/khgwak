- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kyeonghwan Gwak(ê³½ê²½í™˜) ðŸ¤—       
&emsp;I am an undergraduate student at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">UNIST</a>), where I am double majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (<a href="https://cse.unist.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">CSE</a>) and Mathematical Sciences. I'm also an undergraduate intern in the UNIST Vision & Learning LAB (<a href="https://vision.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">UVLL</a>), led by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bsrvision00/" target="_blank">Prof. Seungryul Baek</a>. In addition, I've been selected as the candidate for Research Officers for National Defense (<a href="https://rond.or.kr/" target="_blank">ROND</a>) in the field of EECS.  
I have a keen interest in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and the philosophy of science.
